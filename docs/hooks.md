# Hooks

## Configuration

You can trigger an HTTP POST request to any URL you want when any of the Xen Orchestra API methods is called.

* Go to Settings > Plugins > Hooks
* Add new hooks
* For each hook, configure:
  * Method: the XO API method that will trigger the HTTP request when called
  * Type:
    * pre: the request will be sent right before the method is run
    * post: the request will be sent after the method action is fully completed
  * URL: the full URL the requests will be sent to
* Save the plugin configuration

From now on, everytime the methods you configured will be called by any of the XOA's clients, a request will be sent to the URLs bound to it.

## Request content

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
```

Body:

```json
{
  "method": <method name>,
  "params": <call parameters>,
  "type": "pre"|"post",
  "result": <call result if post type>
}
```

## Request handle

*Quick NodeJS example of how you may want to handle the requests*

```js
const http = require('http')
const { exec } = require('child_process')

http
  .createServer((req, res) => {
    let body
    req.on('data', chunk => {
      body += chunk
    })
    req.on('end', () => handleHook(body))
    res.end()
  })
  .listen(3000)

const handleHook = data => {
  const { method, params, type, result } = JSON.parse(data)

  // Log it
  console.log(`${Date.now()} [${method}|${type}] ${params} â†’ ${result}`)

  // Run scripts
  exec(`./hook-scripts/${method}-${type}.sh`)
}
```
